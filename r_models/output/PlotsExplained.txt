Summary of Bayesian Regression Results
Model type: Bayesian linear regression (brms)

Formula:
Spend = Intercept + Campaign Effect + Random Noise

Key Findings:
Term	Estimate	    95% Credible Interval	    Interpretation
Intercept (baseline)	144.34	137.65 to 151.08	Average spend without campaign
Campaign Effect	+84.32	75.02 to 93.49	            Increase in spend when campaign is received

Sigma (noise / unexplained variance): 92.49 (credible interval: 87.58 to 97.84)

This reflects natural variability in spend not explained by the campaign.

Diagnostics:
Metric	Result	Interpretation
Rhat	1.00	✅ Good convergence (no chain issues)
Effective Samples (ESS)	High (3600–4600)	✅ Reliable estimation

Plain English Summary:
Running the campaign increased average customer spend by about 84 units (±5).
Without the campaign, the average spend was around 144 units.
The model converged well, and the results are statistically credible.

Why This Matters:
The campaign had a strong positive effect on customer spend.

Bayesian modeling provides uncertainty ranges, not just point estimates—giving you a full picture of possible outcomes.

These results can guide future marketing budgets and decisions.
