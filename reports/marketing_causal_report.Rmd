# 1. Project Overview

This project estimates the **causal impact of marketing campaigns** using an integrated **R + Python pipeline** deployed via **AWS**.

### Objectives:

- Determine the **true effect** of a marketing campaign on user spend and churn
- Use a **Bayesian approach** to model uncertainty in uplift estimation
- Provide a **real-time API** for targeting decisions using a surrogate Machine Learning model

---


# 2. Data Pipeline

## Data Generation

- **Simulated Users Dataset:** `simulated_users.csv`  
- Stored in **AWS S3** (`marketing-causal-data` bucket)

### Data Features:

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `user_id` | Unique customer ID |
| `signup_date` | User registration date |
| `spend` | User's cumulative spend |
| `churn_days` | Time until churn (days) |
| `received_campaign` | Treatment flag (1 = received campaign) |

# 3. Causal Modeling in R

## 3.1 Bayesian Regression (`brms`)

A probabilistic regression model was fit using `brms` to estimate treatment effects with uncertainty.

> _Note: In this iteration, `brms_summary.csv` is optional and not displayed here._

---

## 3.2 Time Series Causal Impact (`CausalImpact`)

Googleâ€™s `CausalImpact` package was used to analyze **pre- and post-campaign periods**.

### Method:

- **Pre-period:** First 50% of data (no campaign effect)
- **Post-period:** Remaining 50% (campaign active)

```r
# Load Causal Impact Summary
summary_txt <- readLines(here::here("r_models/output/causal_impact_summary.txt"))
cat(summary_txt, sep = "\n")
CausalImpact Plot:

```r
knitr::include_graphics("r_models/output/causal_impact_plot.pdf")


4. Survival Analysis (User Churn)
Analyzed churn behavior using Kaplan-Meier survival curves to estimate retention.

Plot of Churn Survival by Group:
```r
knitr::include_graphics("r_models/output/survival_plot.pdf")

Cox Proportional Hazards Model:
```r
# Load Cox model summary
cox_summary <- readLines(here::here("r_models/output/cox_summary.txt"))
cat(cox_summary, sep = "\n")


5. Surrogate ML Model (Python)
A PyTorch Neural Network (SimpleNN) was trained to mimic the Bayesian uplift predictions for real-time inference.

API Integration:
Deployed via FastAPI

Input: user_id, past spend

Output: Predicted future spend (treated vs control) + uplift

Example Output:
User ID	Past Spend	Predicted Spend (Treated)	Predicted Spend (Control)	Uplift
1	    100	        285.12	                    98.59	                    186.53

6. Dashboard Deployment
Architecture:
pgsql

[User Input] --> [Shiny Dashboard]  
                  |  
                  |--> /predict_uplift (FastAPI API) --> PyTorch Surrogate Model  
                  |--> R plots & summaries (CausalImpact, Survival, etc.)  
Hosting:
Component	Technology
Dashboard	R Shiny
API	FastAPI (Python)
Storage	AWS S3

7. Key Findings
The marketing campaign increased user spend significantly in the post-period.

Surrogate model predictions provide real-time uplift estimates, enabling targeted campaign delivery.

Survival analysis revealed that campaign recipients churned less frequently than the control group.

8. Next Steps
Containerize with Docker for scalable deployment

Expand causal models to multiple campaigns or treatments

Develop automated pipeline for real-time decisioning
